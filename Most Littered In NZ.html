                <h2>Most Littered Places in NZ</h2>
                <p>Cigarette butts make up an unbelievable 78% of all litter gathered during beach clean-ups in New Zealand, making them the most common kind of litter along with plastic trash. In addition to the overwhelming amount, there are a lot of common misconceptions regarding cigarette butts, which makes this concerning. These filters are improperly disposed of because many New Zealanders do not understand that they are plastic garbage. There are serious environmental consequences; each year, more than 1.4 billion cigarette butts litter the nation, harming wildlife and waterways. Increasing public awareness of cigarette filters' non-biodegradable nature and establishing clear disposal choices are two practical ways to address this problem. Organizations that promote a feeling of "pride and ownership" over one's surroundings have demonstrated potential in reducing littering rates. A ban on single-use artificial filters is another political step that might greatly reduce this environmental harm and encourage smokers to develop sustainable habits.

                <H2>Plastic Litter is not OKAY</H2>
                <p>Because of its widespread use in daily life and inadequate waste management techniques, plastic is one of the most littered materials in New Zealand. About 80% of marine debris comes from land-based sources, and poorly managed plastic waste is a major factor in this problem. The nation's pollution levels are made worse by a heavy reliance on plastic and a weak recycling system. Moreover, the idea of "waste colonialism" clarifies how underprivileged groups MƒÅori are particularly impacted by plastic pollution. They are particularly sensitive to environmental damage brought on by plastic waste because of their strong ties to the land and the sea. Adopting sustainable habits and pushing for major changes in waste management laws are essential if New Zealanders are to properly solve this challenge.  </p>

                <h2>What can we do?</h2>
                <p>Taking your litter with you is the only way we can prevent littering! We can prevent littering by acting morally and picking up trash, even if it is not ours. Some tips include packing food and other supplies in reusable containers, removing packaging, and attempting to make your trip easier by producing as little waste as possible when you're arranging it. In addition to being damaging litter, food scraps can also be avoided by packing away all litter, including food scraps, to safeguard New Zealand wildlife rather than providing food for stoats, rats, and mice. </p>
