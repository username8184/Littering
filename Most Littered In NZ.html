                <h2>Most Littered Places in NZ</h2>
                <p>Cigarette butts make up an unbelievable 78% of all litter gathered during beach clean-ups in New Zealand, making them the most common kind of litter along with plastic trash. In addition to the overwhelming amount, there are a lot of common misconceptions regarding cigarette butts, which makes this concerning. These filters are improperly disposed of because many New Zealanders do not understand that they are plastic garbage. There are serious environmental consequences; each year, more than 1.4 billion cigarette butts litter the nation, harming wildlife and waterways. Increasing public awareness of cigarette filters' non-biodegradable nature and establishing clear disposal choices are two practical ways to address this problem. Organizations that promote a feeling of "pride and ownership" over one's surroundings have demonstrated potential in reducing littering rates. A ban on single-use artificial filters is another political step that might greatly reduce this environmental harm and encourage smokers to develop sustainable habits.

                <h2>What can we do?</h2>
                <p>Taking your litter with you is the only way we can prevent littering! We can prevent littering by acting morally and picking up trash, even if it is not ours. Some tips include packing food and other supplies in reusable containers, removing packaging, and attempting to make your trip easier by producing as little waste as possible when you're arranging it. In addition to being damaging litter, food scraps can also be avoided by packing away all litter, including food scraps, to safeguard New Zealand wildlife rather than providing food for stoats, rats, and mice. </p>
