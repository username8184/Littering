                <h2>What can we do?</h2>
                <p>Taking your litter with you is the only way we can prevent littering! We can prevent littering by acting morally and picking up trash, even if it is not ours. Some tips include packing food and other supplies in reusable containers, removing packaging, and attempting to make your trip easier by producing as little waste as possible when you're arranging it. In addition to being damaging litter, food scraps can also be avoided by packing away all litter, including food scraps, to safeguard New Zealand wildlife rather than providing food for stoats, rats, and mice. </p>
