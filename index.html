                <h2>Effects of Littering</h2>
                <p>Jason Taumalolo, now 31, was once a dominant force in rugby league and remains a cherished and influential figure, especially for Tonga. Known for his power and agility, he transformed Tongaâ€™s rugby league status by switching his international allegiance from New Zealand to Tonga in 2017. This move inspired a new era, with Tonga rising as a respected team on the global stage. Despite his age and changing physical abilities, Taumalolo continues to be effective and revered, embodying Tongan pride. His legacy transcends his on-field accomplishments, setting a standard of dedication to heritage that continues to inspire the sport's future.
