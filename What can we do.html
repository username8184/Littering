                <h2>What can we do to stop Littering in NZ</h2>
                <p>As demonstrated by a recent National Litter Audit that found an unbelievable 436% rise in litter since 2019, littering is a major problem in New Zealand. To properly address this problem, comprehensive efforts need to be put into place. Increasing the strictness of current littering rules is one workable option. According to research, people are less likely to litter when they believe they have a high chance of getting caught. Therefore, harsher punishments and more surveillance may discourage potential lawbreakers. 

                    Improving public awareness efforts that support positive standards around waste disposal is another successful strategy. Research indicates that encouraging a sense of pride and responsibility in local settings greatly lowers the amount of trash that occurs. Initiatives for community engagement that motivate locals to support local regions or take part in cleanup events can help achieve this. Lastly, cigarette butt litter, which now makes up 76.7% of urban litter, can be decreased by making waste disposal bins more visible and accessible. We can encourage the public to dispose of waste properly by making sure these bins are easily accessible and kept in good condition. New Zealand can strive to restore its "clean, green" image while encouraging environmental stewardship by carrying out these varied initiatives.

                <p> Educating kids about these behaviors at a young age can help them develop lasting habits, improving public areas is essential to lowering the amount of littering. By encouraging positive standards of behavior, cities with clean and well-maintained spaces prevent littering habits. Cities should prioritize long-term improvements to their networks rather than depending only on anti-litter signage, which research has proven to be mainly unsuccessful. Lastly, addressing current litter issues and encouraging a sense of ownership among locals can be accomplished through community engagement through planned cleanup programs. In addition to removing trash, taking part in these events strengthens links among the community and promotes constant caution against littering. Through a combination of educational programs, environmental improvements, and community engagement, we can develop a comprehensive strategy to successfully reduce littering.  </p>
