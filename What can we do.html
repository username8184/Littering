                <h2>What can we do to stop Littering in NZ</h2>
                <p>As demonstrated by a recent National Litter Audit that found an unbelievable 436% rise in litter since 2019, littering is a major problem in New Zealand. To properly address this problem, comprehensive efforts need to be put into place. Increasing the strictness of current littering rules is one workable option. According to research, people are less likely to litter when they believe they have a high chance of getting caught. Therefore, harsher punishments and more surveillance may discourage potential lawbreakers.

                <H2>Plastic Litter is not OKAY</H2>
                <p>Because of its widespread use in daily life and inadequate waste management techniques, plastic is one of the most littered materials in New Zealand. About 80% of marine debris comes from land-based sources, and poorly managed plastic waste is a major factor in this problem. The nation's pollution levels are made worse by a heavy reliance on plastic and a weak recycling system. Moreover, the idea of "waste colonialism" clarifies how underprivileged groups MƒÅori are particularly impacted by plastic pollution. They are particularly sensitive to environmental damage brought on by plastic waste because of their strong ties to the land and the sea. Adopting sustainable habits and pushing for major changes in waste management laws are essential if New Zealanders are to properly solve this challenge.  </p>

                <h2>Cigarette Butts are HARMFUL</h2>
                <p>Since they make up 78% of the litter in New Zealand, cigarette butts are a major environmental problem. Despite being ignored as simple litter, the plastic content of these butts and the chemicals they discharge into soil and waterways make them serious ecological threats. The frequency of cigarette butt littering emphasizes how urgently effective solutions are needed. 76.7% of smokers disposed of their butts incorrectly despite having many options for disposal. Activities for public education are therefore crucial to changing attitudes about cigarette waste and encouraging appropriate disposal methods.
