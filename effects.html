                <h2>Effects of Littering</h2>
                <p>Different individuals and sources contribute to the effects of litter. For example, it could be purposeful littering by drivers throwing trash out of windows, by pedestrians leaving trash on the sidewalks or the street, or by individuals attending public events like picnics.  
 
                    The existence and evolution of people, animals, and the natural environment can all be threatened by litter. The main effects are the risk to human health, the potential for fire dangers, the potential for species to be endangered or killed, and the significant harm to rivers. Litter also has an impact on our quality of life and the tourism industry, both directly and indirectly. Because of this careless pollution, removing litter from the environment costs a lot of money that could have been spent on protecting the environment.
