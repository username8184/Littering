                <h2>Effects of Littering</h2>
                <p>Different individuals and sources contribute to the effects of litter. For example, it could be purposeful littering by drivers throwing trash out of windows, by pedestrians leaving trash on the sidewalks or the street, or by individuals attending public events like picnics.  
 
                    The existence and evolution of people, animals, and the natural environment can all be threatened by litter. The main effects are the risk to human health, the potential for fire dangers, the potential for species to be endangered or killed, and the significant harm to rivers. Litter also has an impact on our quality of life and the tourism industry, both directly and indirectly. Because of this careless pollution, removing litter from the environment costs a lot of money that could have been spent on protecting the environment.

                <p>Litter has a negative environmental impact. Toxic substances or chemicals found in litter can be blown or carried into rivers, woods, lakes, and seas, eventually contaminating soil, waterways, and aquatic habitats. This can happen on the streets, along roads, or near trash cans. According to recent research, the majority of the 7 billion tons of garbage that enter the world's oceans each year is made of strong plastic. Because of the odor and chemical or toxic vapor that the rubbish releases, litter also lowers the quality of the air. Diseases can spread more easily in an environment that is contaminated. Trash containing toxic chemicals and microbes that cause illness can also contaminate water systems and spread illnesses transmitted by water that can harm human and animal health if untreated or dirty water is drank. Despite the widespread belief that cigarette butts harm quickly in a matter of days cellulose oxide causes cigarette butts to take a total of ten years to break down. Cigarette butts pose a major environmental risk since they contain harmful materials like arsenic that can contaminate water and soil. </p>

                <p>The fact that littering is too costly for an entire country, society, and individuals is another drawback. Large sums of taxpayer-funded funds that could be used for more beneficial purposes are needed to clean up rubbish. Littered areas are unattractive and decrease the aesthetic and actual worth of the surrounding areas. Locations with high trash levels are sometimes associated with less valuable homes and property. Similar to this, trash has an effect on tourism since it makes roadsides and urban areas appear disgusting, and visitors prefer to avoid staying in or even going to places that are littered. Littering can also result in car crashes. A small amount of rubbish on the road can cause an unsafe situation that could lead to serious injuries or death.
